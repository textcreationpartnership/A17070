            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE PRACTICAL METHODE OF MEDITATION.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>EDITATION which we treate of, is nothing els but a dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t &amp; forcible applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, to ſeeke, and knowe, and as it were to taſt ſome diuine matter; from whence doth ariſe in our affectionate powers good motions, inclinations, and purpoſes which ſtirre vs vp to the loue and
<pb facs="tcp:14623:7"/> exerciſe of vertue, and the hatred &amp; auoiding of ſinne: it is the ſhorteſt &amp; almoſt the only way to attaine to Chriſtian perfection: it is the path which all holy men (of what eſtate ſoeuer) haue troden. Wherfore let thoſe, who deſire to enioy their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, follow their example.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And ſurely it ſeemes a thing, euen impoſſible, to arriue vnto any notable degree of perfection with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this ſo neceſſary a meanes. For perfection beeing nothing els, but the rooting out, of vices, and planting of vertues in our ſoules: vnles we withdraw our affections from earthly obiects, and ſettle the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> on heauenly, we ſhall neuer per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the one, nor attaine to the other. And ſeeing that our affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate part imbraceth nothing, vnleſſe our vnderſtanding both know it, and iudge of it, neither can it find out fit obiects for heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly affections vnles it diſcourſe on them, nor moue therwith the will, except it conſider the goodnes which often lieth hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
<pb facs="tcp:14623:7"/> in them; it followeth euidently, that without meditation no man can attaine to any height of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Beſides, it is the moſt excellent manner of praiſing God, employing euery power of our ſoule, in ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing forth the excellencies of their Creator, which is the chiefeſt end of our creation: neither doth it reſt heere, but bringeth a man to heauen (that ſo I may ſay) before his tyme, making him enioy (after a ſort) eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in this life the bleſſednes of the life to come: which being nothing els but the ſeeing, louing, and enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Gods diuine Maieſty, we giuing our ſelues by meditation to the moſt perfect knowledge, to the ſtraiteſt bande of loue, and the ſweeteſt fruition of God which this wretched life affoards, we participate in the beſt manner which our eſtate will permit vs, of the happines of the Bleſſed in heauen.</p>
            <p n="4">4. True it is, that through the vnhappy eſtate of this troubleſome
<pb facs="tcp:14623:8"/> world, man beeing diſtracted by other thoughts, and ſurpriſed by other affections, cannot co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinually, nor without ſome little violence, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially at the firſt, enioy this ſo great a happines: yet may he, ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his owne diligence to Gods help, ſo vnite himſelfe to his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor by this exerciſe, that at leaſt for ſome determinate time, he may enioy him with ſome familiarity.</p>
            <p n="5">5. It will therfore be good for thoſe, who intende to reape the fruit of this heauenly emploiment, to appointe vnto themſelues, by the counſell of ſome one ſkilfull in matters of ſpirit, the tyme they meane to ſpend euery day therin, and that with ſo ſtedfaſt a reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that they make conſcience to omit it without vrgent occaſion; which omiſſion (although nece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſary) let them ſupply at ſome other tyme of the day, if it be poſſible. And let them be but diligent &amp; conſtant at the beginning, &amp; it will proue an excerciſe moſt full of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
<pb facs="tcp:14623:8"/> profit and delight, which will aboundantly counteruaile the paines beſtowed therin.</p>
            <p n="6">6. And let thoſe who thinke Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to belong only to Religious perſons, and that ſecular ought not or need not buſy themſelues ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, be fully perſuaded, that they ar in an errour very pernicious. For as ſecular men haue more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractions by reaſon of their diuers worldly employments, then Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious, more temptations by the continuall preſence of many allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring obiects, more imperfections, ſinnes, and ill habits to conquer: ſo haue they more need to retire themſelues by this holy recollectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to propoſe vnto themſelues the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gheſt obiects moſt worthy of loue, affection, and proſecution, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe themſelues in the acts of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> nobleſt verues; all which is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by meditation. And if re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious perſons being Gods ſworne ſouldiars, vſe theſe weapons, as thinges belonging to their eſtate
<pb facs="tcp:14623:9"/> and dignity, ſecular people muſt put them on alſo, at leaſt for their neceſſary defence; and of theſe many do make great change of life and happy progreſſe in vertue by this exerciſe, euen in this cold age of ours. And although they are more frequent in other Countreys, which enioy the happy freedome of the ſeruice of God, without feares or contradictions: yet there want not ſuch (and that of both ſexes) euen amongeſt vs, who ouercomming the tumults of the world, and the terrors of perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, do beſtow daily a good part of their tyme in this importa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and continually reap the ple<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull fruit of their happy labours; which number if it may be increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by this my poore endeauour, I ſhall thinke it happily beſtowed.</p>
            <p n="7">7. And although the holy Ghoſt be the chiefe Maiſter of this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, yet it ſhall not be amiſſe to ſet downe ſome briefe method of practiſe, taken out of approued
<pb facs="tcp:14623:9"/> Authors and experience, that ſo thoſe who haue a will to imploy themſelues therein, bee not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued (at leaſt of a great part) of the profit, for want of inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>
            <p n="8">8. We ſhall heere omit diuers diuiſions which might be made of meditation, and deuide it only into Spirituall and Hiſtoricall, which diſtinction is taken from the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſitie of the matter wheron we meditate. Spirituall meditation is that, wherin the matter is ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall, in that ſenſe, as we oppoſe ſpirituall to corporall, for that it containes for the moſt part no cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall actions: ſuch are the Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the end of man, of ſinnes, death, iudgment, hell, heauen, the benefits of God, his infinite per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, &amp; the like. Hiſtoricall Meditation is that, where the matter is ſome Hiſtorie, as the meditations of the life &amp; paſſion of our B. Sauiour, of the vertuous actions of his B. Mother, or ſome
